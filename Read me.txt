Have created complete database Script

Have created 3 pages in Angular
1- Login Page
http://localhost/HospitalMIS-master/index.html#!/login

2- Welcome page also shows Register User Page

Not completed 
--------------
1- Patients add page but they can check I have implemented user registration (Add functionality)
2- Patients List view Page (All registered user can be displayed on welcome page)

Was planning to add proper authorization and Authentication, once can see my database script for details, I have added role-permission based tables
